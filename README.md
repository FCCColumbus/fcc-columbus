# F3C_Website

Free Code Camp is an open source learning community that helps beginner coders learn to develop for the web. Free Code Camp Columbus is a sub-group called a campsite loosely affiliated with the parent group of Free Code Camp. Here at Free Code Camp Columbus we have created a group website to bring all of our many group interaction technologies into one unified application to grow as a group and also learn to code along the way.

Contributions to this website are restricted to Free Code Camp Columbus campers only.
